        <h1>Hey, I'm Tedgey</h1>
        <p>Which is my nickname, a combination of Tom (first name) and Edgeworth (you get one guess). I'm a web developer in training and this is my <em>first</em> 
            HTML website. So far, I've learned a bunch of python but I'm really excited to get into some more front-end content.
        </p>
        <h2>Before working with computers I worked in sales, mostly on a computer.</h2>
        <p>All inside sales. This meant lots of phone calls, perfecting a pitch, and more phone calls. I lived that life for about 5 years and I couldn't be happier to be out.
        I've always been an analytical person who loved process, and pretty good at faking extrovertness, so the sales life was okay, but not the life I wasnted forever. 
        Dev life is the way to go :)
        </p>
        <h3>I'm competitive as hell</h3>
        <p>Which is why I thought that I would be good at sales. *Spoiler alert* it didn't transfer to sales. I'm not competitive when I'm being forced to be competitive. 
            When It's my choice, however, I want to win in everything I do. Coming from a family of athletes, I believe it's in my blood. My
            brother plays minor league baseball, my sister played volleyball in college and won their conference championship multiple times, and I played lacrosse in college (also a conference champ). 
            While true competitive sports are behind me I've found different ways to scratch that itch.

        <h4>My latest adventure was in the esports world.</h4>
        <p>
            About a month ago I competed in an open qualifier for a game called Playerunknown's Battlegrounds, or PUBG for short. My team and I made it through to the <em>final</em> 
            round of the open qualifiers, only to fall short of our goal to secure a top 4 spot out of the 16 teams that played. Had we secured one of the 4 spots, we 
            would have been invited to the PUBG "Contenders" League, which is basically the minor leagues of PUBG. (Some of the teams in Contenders even make a salary)
        </p>
        <h5>So what now, Tedgey?</h5>
        <p>Good question, Questioner! I'm taking a "break" from competitive PUBG while I'm at DigitalCrafts so I can fully focus on learning coding! Maybe one day that competitive 
            urge will come back, but I couldn't be happier with my choice to put PUBG on the backburner. In the meantime, I still play the game (but only after I've finished my homework).
